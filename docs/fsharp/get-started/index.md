If you'd rather not install F# and .NET on your machine, you can also get started with F# in the browser:

* [Introduction to F# on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dotnet/try/master?urlpath=lab) is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) on hosted via the free [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service. No sign-up needed!
* [The Fable REPL](https://fable.io/repl/) is an interactive, in-browser REPL that uses [Fable](https://fable.io/) to translate F# code into JavaScript. Check out the numerous samples that range from F# basics to a fully fledged video game all executing in your browser!
